In this package we are implementing a package which is calling a *Web API* called Nasa Asteroid using R programming language. The package calls nasa asteroid api which is nasa api called from the site <https://api.nasa.gov/#getting-started>. For this purpose we first got are API key from *nasa.gov* and then after authentication we called are API in are package. 
  
The first step in the implementation is importing a library called httr which is designed to map closely to the underlying http protocol.

```{r}
library(httr)
r <- GET("https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse")
```


As a second step we are initializing are function and creating a dataframe called df. 
 
We are calling field in the data frame from are NASA ASTEROID API which are:

- Name
- absolute_magnitude_h
- estimated_diameter_kilometers_min
- estimated_diameter_kilometers_max
- is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid
- close_approach_data_date
- orbital_period
